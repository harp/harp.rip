        ### Report a bug

        If you think you’ve found a bug, or something is not behaving as advertised, please report it. The best way to do that is [open an issue on Github](http://github.com/sintaxi/harp/issues). IF you include what operating system you are running, the version of NodeJS, Harp, and steps to reproduce the problem, then you are especially awesome.

        ### Help improve the docs

        If something in the docs is wrong, confusing or just doesn't make sense, please let us know by opening an issue and we will do our best to fix it. If you have an idea for a guide, tutorial or screen cast please send it to [@HarpWebServer](http://twitter.com/harpwebserver); we will happily feature it in <cite>Harp Weekly</cite>.

        If you want to add a new feature, one of the maintainers would love to chat with you first to make sure the feature is inline with the project philosophy and design goals.
