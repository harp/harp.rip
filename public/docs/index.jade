        # Harp Documentation

        [Install Harp](/docs/quick-start)<br/>
        Get started quickly with a screencast and tutorial.

        [Understanding the basics](/docs/development/rules)</br>
        Five simple rules you can count on while making your own Harp applications.

        ## Environment

        Learn how to run Harp wherever you need it:

        * [Locally](/docs/environment/install), while you design and develop static sites or client-side applications
        * [As Middleware](/docs/environment/lib), making Harp the asset pipeline for a larger application built with Express and Node.js
        * [In Production](/docs/environment/server), where Harp will act as a web server, caching and can serve static content

        ## Development

        Read [The Rules](/docs/development/rules), a single page crash course in getting the most out of Harp right away.

        If you are using preprocessors to write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, Harp will make your project dramatically easier. Harp supports [Markdown](/docs/development/markdown), [EJS](/docs/development/ejs), [Jade](/docs/development/jade), [LESS](/docs/development/less), [Sass](/docs/development/sass), [Stylus](/docs/development/stylus), and [CoffeeScript](/docs/development/coffeescript).

        ## Deployment

        Learn how to deploy Harp in production mode, and have it serve your application. Or, compile your project into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it’s ready host it anywhere.

        <!-- TODO replace with `harp publish` You can skip this entirely with [the Harp Platform](https://www.harp.io), the easiest way to get a Harp app online. -->
