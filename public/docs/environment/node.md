## Running Harp on Node.js v0.12.x and below

If you are running Node.js v0.12.x or lower, previous version of Harp support it although we __highly__ recommend you upgrade your version of Node.js and Harp instead. If that is truly not an option, here are the final versions of Harp that worked with each corresponding release of Node.js:

- Harp supports Node.js v4.x and up: `npm install -g harp@latest`
- Harp v0.X.X was the final version to support Node.js v0.12.x: `npm install -g harp@v0.x.x`
- Harp v0.X.X was the final version to support Node.js v0.10.x: `npm install -g harp@v0.x.x`
- Harp v0.X.X was the final version to support Node.js v0.8.x: `npm install -g harp@v0.x.x`
