# Update Harp

Whether you are using OS X, Windows, or Linux, you can update Harp to the latest version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g harp
```

If you are using OS X or Linux, you may need to preface the command with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo npm install -g harp
```

Then, you will need to enter your machine’s password. If you’d like to avoid the need to use `sudo` each time you install something globally with npm, read this article on [fixing your npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).
