        Learn how to run Harp wherever you need it:

        * [Locally](/docs/environment/install), while you design and develop static sites or client-side applications
        * [As Middleware](/docs/environment/lib), making Harp the asset pipeline for a larger application built with Express and Node.js
        * [In Production](/docs/environment/server), where Harp will act as a web server, caching and can serve static content
